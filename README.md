# Bootcamp-challenge

This is the Andela Ke Cohort 28 boot camp project for the maintenance/repairs department tracker app

## Description

I am required to make a maintenance or repairs tracker app for the maintenance/operations department. The users should be able to sign in if they already have an account or sign up if they do not have one.The users should be able to make requests as well as view their requests.

The application should also allow for admins to log in and see each request that has been made, approve or reject it and resolve the request


## Requirements

- Git
- Github account
- Pivotal tracker
- Python
- Flask
- Postgresql
- Preferred editor-Sublime text/VsCode
- Postman app

## Challenge 1: User Interface

After carefully reading the instructions, we are required to first make pivotal tracker stories and create a github repository initialized with a readme.md file and clone it. Create a new develop branch off master and add a feature branch. In the feature branch create a directory calling it UI where you will save all the pages you have created. After completing with the features we merge the feature branch with develop branch and create pull requests for our pivotal tracker stories Design the front end user interface for the application, which will outline the stipulated tasks. HTML, CSS and Javascript should be used for the design and responsiveness of the interface. No pre-built frameworks such as bootstrap should be used in the project.

## Features required are:
    1. Users can create an account and log in.
    2. The users should be able to make maintenance or repairs request.
    3. An admin should be able to approve/reject a repair/maintenance request.
    4. The admin should be able to mark request as resolved once it is done.
    5. The admin should be able to view all maintenance/repairs requests on the application
    6. The admin should be able to filter requests
    7. The user can view all his/her requests
